My AOC 2020 solutions

## 2021
Completed with Racket.

Each subfolder is one seperate question and is meant to be able to run in isolation from other questions.

## 2020
Completed with Rust

Each subfolder is one seperate question and is meant to be able to run in isolation from other questions.

Running `cargo build` will build all binaries for all the days and parts

Each day and part is given a specific name in the format of `day_<day number>_part_<part number>`. For example, If I wanted to run the solution for Day 10 Part 1, `cargo run day_10_part_2`.

Preferably, each binary should be built in the top level directory instead of their own respective folders as it may cause some issues when looking for the input file.
