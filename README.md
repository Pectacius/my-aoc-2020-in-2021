My AOC 2020 solutions in Rust only using standard library

Each folder is one seperate question and is meant to be able to run in isolation from other questions.

Running `cargo build` will build all binaries for all the days and parts

Each day and part is given a specific name in the format of `day_<day number>_part_<part number>`. For example, If I wanted to run the solution for Day 10 Part 1, `cargo run day_10_part_2`.
